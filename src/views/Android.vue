      <p>Statistically speaking, Android’s operating system (OS) is the most used worldwide, with a whopping 71.93% global market share as of January 2021 (“Mobile Operating System Market Share Worldwide”).</p>
      <p>In the United States, the number of Android smartphone users increased from 129.1 to 131.2 million over the past year (“Number of Android smartphone users in the United States from 2014 to 2022”). The sheer number of Android devices in the United States highlights how significant Pichai and his products are, and the 2.1 million unit increase in shipments shows that they are still relevant in the United States.</p>
      <p>Android’s humongous global market share was in part due to Sundar Pichai’s marketing efforts for Android as a collaborative project throughout the organization of Google, and as a worldwide player that compromises with the competitors around it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p2">
      <p>Prior to Sundar Pichai’s acquisition of the leadership position over Android, Andy Rubin, the previous head of Android, “operated the unit in an insular way” (Gupta) such that one Google employee remarked that his style “was responsible for the only shouting matches he’s witnessed in the upper ranks at the company” (Stone).</p>
      <p>Sundar Pichai brought Android to a global level by fostering a more collaborative mindset between Android and its original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s), such as Motorola, who “never got any special treatment from the Android team” (Gupta) under Rubin’s management. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="p3">
      <p>In 2014, after a startling surprise by Samsung at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Pichai convinced Samsung’s CEO, J.K. Shin, to remove Samsung’s Magazine UX software from their phones, as it hid Google products such as the Play Store and Maps.</p>
      <p>This negotiation allowed the two companies to “work together more closely on user experience than we ever have before,” according to Pichai (Stone), thus illustrating how Pichai’s rise to Android’s leadership position resulted in a more cooperative relationship with its partners, whereas before, mediocre businesses allowed miscommunications to occur during projects (Moon). </p>
    </div>
    <div id="p4">
      <p>Not only that, but even when Samsung boasted about its own OS called Tizen and the possibility of decreasing their dependency on Android’s OS, Pichai responded in a level-head manner, saying, “I view Tizen as a choice which people can have,” and “we need to make sure Android is the better choice” (Stone). </p>
      <p>This impartial yet motivated response to Samsung’s boasting is different from how Rubin may have responded, as Rubin’s methodology involved “choosing a different company each year for early access to the newest version of the software” to foster “competition among phonemakers” (Stone). </p>
      <p>This manipulative and insular workstyle may have caused Rubin to either shut out or relegate Samsung to the background if he had managed Android during the Tizen situation, thus showing how Pichai’s (differing cultural background) Asian American mindset allowed him to maintain a humble attitude when confronted with inconveniences. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="p5">
      <p>Sundar Pichai’s uniquely Asian views of observing the big picture, having a collective mindset, and finding win-win situations have transformed the business world today, and modernized the monopoly’s approach to maintaining business relationships.</p>
