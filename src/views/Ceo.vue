      <p>Due to Google’s large role in how society functions today, Sundar Pichai has a great reach on society with his position as the CEO</p>
      <p>For example, Google played a large role in helping the nation with the pandemic, and Sundar and Google made the decision to converse with the US gov’s COVID task force (conveys his BIG impact, as he directly spoke to them himself)</p>
      <p>They also decided to focus on areas where their expertise could help: what can Google do to provide more information, and Verily (an Alphabet scientific research company) was working on providing more testing (specifically drive-thru testing to first responders)</p>
      <p>Sundar says “My view on this is at a time of a global pandemic, we want to do everything we can to help the US government succeed…”</p>
      <p>These actions impact the world in a crisis such as COVID-19 to a great extent, demonstrating Sundar’s reach as the CEO of a high profile company</p>
      <p>Google and Verily work on healthcare also, again impacting society. Sundar’s position has also impacted education during the pandemic, as his company has worked on things such as donating chromebooks. His position impacts the environment as he is in charge of Google’s work on sustainable products and carbon emissions, and he has stated that Google is working on becoming completely carbon free by 2030, 24/7 everywhere they operate. Google is currently carbon neutral.</p>

      <p>Sundar has broken barriers, or the “bamboo ceiling,” as it is frequently called, in terms of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans in executive positions, yet it is still very difficult for this to happen - the fact that the company he is heading is Google creates tremendous hope for future Asian Americans who have big aspirations</p>
      <p>According to Karthik Ramakrishnan, associate dean of public policy at UC Riverside, and Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at Columbia University,  “[Asians] may be hired in large numbers by tech companies, but Asian Americans are the group least likely to be promoted into managerial and executive ranks. Whites are twice as likely as Asians to hold executive positions.” </p>
      <p>This conveys how the model minority myth can be perpetuated and how many people can feel that Asians do not face problems in the business world, whereas the truth is that the problem is deeper - it arises when looking at the ranks of the Asians hired in tech companies</p>

    </div>
    <div id="p3">
      <p>Many companies argue that first generation Asian immigrants, who migrated to America, may generally rank high in “hard skill,” they lack “soft skill,” AKA ability to communicate effectively due to barriers such as an accent or less proficient English → however the authors of the LA Times piece argue that Asians are not given opportunities to present their ability to communicate effectively → 51% of Asians have led a meeting whereas 68% of whites have → demonstrated through Sundar Pichai as he has an accent yet he is clearly able to communicate well (and he is an Indian Immigrant) (stats apply to both immigrants and American born Asians)</p>
      <p>The authors also point out that Asian Americans (born in America) are still faced with prejudice in the workplace in terms of executive positions, demonstrating that regardless of language barriers, etc., Asians are still discriminated against</p>
